# chordTrack
Routines to identify and display chords in Logic Pro X

Paste this into Logic Scripter and save it. I saved it as "seekAndSpell". 

step 1) Put your chords on a track set for an external instrument sending to an IAC bus.
step 2) Create a second instrument track with the input set for IAC bus, and the script loaded into Logic Scripter.
step 3) run the script in Logic Scripter
step 4) enable record on the second track
step 5) press record and allow the entire track to play through.
